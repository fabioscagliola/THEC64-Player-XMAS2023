# THEC64 Player XMAS2023

A music player for the Commodore 64 including "Feliz Navidad" by Jos√© Feliciano.

## Introduction

Since 2019 I have been wishing happy winter holidays to my family and friends by sharing with them a video of my [THEC64](https://retrogames.biz/thec64) playing a winter holiday song.

## Development

I developed the music player using [CBM prg Studio](https://www.ajordison.co.uk) and tested it using [C64 Forever](https://www.c64forever.com/).
